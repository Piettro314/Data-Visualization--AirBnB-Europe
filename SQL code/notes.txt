The term "attraction index" of a city is not a commonly used or widely recognized term. However, one possible interpretation is that it refers to a measure of how attractive a city is to visitors or potential residents based on various factors such as cultural offerings, entertainment options, natural beauty, economic opportunities, and quality of life.

This attraction index could be calculated using a variety of metrics, such as the number of museums, theaters, restaurants, parks, and other attractions in the city, as well as factors such as crime rates, cost of living, and average income.

It's worth noting that the specific definition and calculation of an attraction index would likely vary depending on who is using the term and what their specific goals or interests are.
