# Preface
There are several visualization tools available for data, such as Power BI, Tableau, and Excel. This project aims to demonstrate the steps involved in creating a visualization and emphasize that the choice of tool ultimately depends on personal preference and availability.

# Objective of the project
To illustrate the process of developing a visualization to analyze AirBnB data in Europe, focusing on the discrepancies between booking patterns on weekdays and weekends. The aim is to project rental rates for both leisure and business travellers in European cities and build a model to forecast prices.

# Data Preparation
I have learnt throuhout my learning that data preparation can be done in multiple ways. For example Data preparation through python using libraries like pandas for cleaning and structuring and seaborn for insights. SQL is another option utlizing joins, groupby, where, case statements and CTE to design your data. Among others.

For this project SQL will be mainly utilized for structuring the Data in preparation for visualization. Data contains 20 CSVs weekend and weekdays divided up by [European cities](https://zenodo.org/record/4446043#.Y9Y9ENJBwUE).
## 1) Import into SQL
* To import into the SQL database a SQL Server Integration Services package was utilized

2) Create a star schema
3) Manage views for later visualization	

# Pycaret
Pycaret will be utilized for 2 main purposes.
1) Mainly to create a predictive model for the prediction of AirBnB prices
2) For quick analysis of the data taking note of feature importance and other insights for later visualization

# Building Visualization
Selecting a tool for visualization. Ease of use, Preference
1) Wire frame BI canvas
2) Build
